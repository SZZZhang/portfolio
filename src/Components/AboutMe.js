              <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Shirley! I'm in my senior year of Computer Science at UWaterloo. I'm interested in graphics, robotics, and AI. My experiences include creating features for digital twining application at the AR startup Interaptix, improving a leading crowd simulation software (MassMotion) at ARUP, and working on the performance of a simulator for the autonomous trucking startup Kodiak Robotics.
